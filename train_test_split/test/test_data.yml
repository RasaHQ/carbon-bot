    - You do know that global warming is bullshit right
    - Not worried
    - NO!  Who benefits?  Who gets the money it is going to cost me?  I despise the UN and all it embodies.  I also do not believe there is such a thing as global warming, and I sure don't agree with your climate change policy either.
    - No, I just wanted to tell you to stay the fuck off my feed you ignorant fuck. Climate change is a hoax , and your suggestion that I can BUY SOMETHING to offset my fossil fuel use proves it. EAT SHIT AND DIE!!!!
