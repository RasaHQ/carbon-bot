  - text: |
      So let me see if I understand this. If you believe the climate change spiel, you can buy your way out of your hypocrisy for flying in those carbon farting containers by lining the pockets of the corrupt UN for "credits"? Seriously? People actually believe this crap?

      Who collects the money I spend on these offsets?

      Isn't it just a big scam

      so no one is making profit  off of me?

      where does that offset money REALLY go?

      This has to be a joke! Who would be dumb enough to fall for this scam?
  - text: |
      what nonsense
  - text: |
      That didn't answer my question. I'm doubtful the money will be used wisely
  - text: |
      How can I ensure the money isn't wasted or abused or corrupted
  - text: |
      Oh sure, I'd just love to waste my hard-earned money giving it to the biggest fraud of modern times, endorsed by a socialist UN that seeks a new world order run by religious fanatics - where do I sign? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüëä

      I don't want to buy offsets. I don't think climate change is a big problem

      No, I heard it is all a hoax
  - text: |
      is climate change even real?
  - text: |
      It's been changing for millions of years because the earth shifts on its axis while spinning in space. Things are going to change naturally, that's why Ohio was a glacier a million years ago and I can find salt water fossils in my backyard in middle Ga.

      It's caused by junk science and NASA is a joke
  - text: |
      Why is there a war against the gas of life ? Definitely not climate change
  - text: |
      Planting trees is positive, especially to offset all of the deforestation that has been done for Solar and Wind Farms. Sadly "Renewable Power" like Ethanol, Solar, Wind and Lithium all use Massive amounts of Fossil Fuels and all have a serious Negative Environmental Impact so I'm not interested in any of those.

      YOU NEED TO PISSOFF WITH THAT BS    Climate!!!!!! What???? Very good Article!  Your thoughts?
      Ian Rutherford Plimer is an Australian geologist, professor emeritus of earth sciences at the University of [Melbourne](city), professor of mining geology at the University of [Adelaide](city), and the director of multiple mineral exploration and mining companies. 
      He has published 130 scientific papers, six books and edited the Encyclopedia of Geology.
      Where Does the Carbon Dioxide Really Come From?
      Professor Ian Plimer could not have said it better!
      If you've read his book you will agree; this is a good summary.
      PLIMER: "Okay, here's the bombshell. The volcanic eruption in [Iceland](city). Since its first spewing of volcanic ash has, in just FOUR DAYS, NEGATED EVERY SINGLE EFFORT you have made in the past five years to control CO2 emissions on our planet - all of you.
      Of course, you know about this evil carbon dioxide that we are trying to suppress ‚Äì it‚Äôs that vital chemical compound that every plant requires to live and grow and to synthesize into oxygen for us humans and all animal life.
      I know....it's very disheartening to realize that all of the carbon emission savings you have accomplished while suffering the inconvenience and expense of driving Prius hybrids, buying fabric grocery bags, sitting up till midnight to finish your kids "The Green Revolution" science project, throwing out all of your non-green cleaning supplies, using only two squares of toilet paper, putting a brick in your toilet tank reservoir, selling your SUV and speedboat, vacation in Bali getting hit every day on your bicycle, replacing all of your 50 cent light bulbs with $10.00 light bulbs.....well, all of those things you have done have all gone down the tubes in just four days.
      The volcanic ash emitted into the Earth's atmosphere in just four days - yes, FOUR DAYS- by that volcano in [Iceland](city) which has totally erased every single effort you have made to reduce the evil beast, carbon. And there are around 200 active volcanoes on the planet spewing out this crud at any one time - EVERY DAY.
      I don't really want to rain on your parade too much, but I should mention that when the volcano Mt. Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991, it spewed out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the entire human race had emitted in all its years on earth.
      Yes, folks, Mt. Pinatubo was active for over one year - think about it.
      Of course, I shouldn't spoil this 'touchy-feely tree-hugging' moment and mention the effect of solar and cosmic activity and the well-recognized 800-year global heating and cooling cycle, which keeps happening despite our completely insignificant efforts to affect climate change.
      And I do wish I had a silver lining to this volcanic ash cloud, but the fact of the matter is that the bush fire season across the western USA and Australia this year alone will negate your efforts to reduce carbon in our world for the next two to three years. And it happens every year. Just remember that your government just tried to impose a whopping carbon tax on you, on the basis of the bogus 'human-caused' climate-change scenario.
      Hey, isn't it interesting how they don't mention 'Global Warming' anymore, but just "Climate Change"- you know why?
      It's because the planet has COOLED by 0.7 degreesin the past century and these global warming bull**** artists got caught with their pants down.   And, just keep in mind that you might yet be stuck with an Emissions Trading Scheme - that whopping new tax - imposed on you that will achieve absolutely nothing except make you poorer.
      It won't stop any volcanoes from erupting, that's for sure.
      But, hey, relax...give the world a hug and have a nice day!"
      GODIS IN CONTROL,ALLOF THE TIME!!!

      Please read proposed 28th amendment...and forward.   This will only take 1 minute to read!
       28th Amendment, 35 States and Counting.
       
       
       
      It will take you less than a minute to read this. If you agree, please pass it on. It's an idea whose time has come to deal with this self-serving situation:
       
       
       OUR PRESENT SITUATION !
       
      Children of Congress members do not have to pay back their college student loans.
       
       
       
      Staffers of Congress family members are also exempt from having to pay back student loans.
       
       
       
      Members of Congress can retire at full pay after only one term.
       
       
       
      Members of Congress have exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed, under which ordinary citizens must live.
       For example, they are exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment.
       
       
       
      And as the latest example, they have exempted themselves from Healthcare Reform, in all of its aspects.
       
       
       
      We must not tolerate an elite class of such people, elected as public servants and then putting themselves above the law.
       
       
       
      I truly don't care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent, or whatever. The self-serving must stop.
       
       
      Governors of 35 states have filed suit against the Federal Government for imposing unlawful burdens upon their states.It only takes 38 (of the 50) States to convene a Constitutional Convention.
       
       
       
      IF???
       
      Each person that receives this will forward it on to 20 people, in three days most people in The United States of America will have the message.
       
       
      Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution:
       
       
      "Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and/or Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and/or Representatives that does not apply equally to the Citizens of the United States ..."
       
       
      You are one of my 20.
      11:30am
      We‚Äôre asking everyone to forward this email to a minimum of 20 people, and to ask each of those to do likewise. 
      In three days, most people in the United States will have the message. This is an idea that should be passed around, regardless of political party. 

      The Congressional Reform Act of 2017 

      1. No Tenure / No Pension. A Congressman/woman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they're out of office. And, no more perks go with them. 

      2. Congress (past, present, & future) participates in Social Security. All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people. It may not be used for any other purpose. 

      3. Congress must purchase their own retirement plan, just as ALL Americans do. 

      4. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%. 

      5. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the American people. 

      6. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people (i.e. NO MORE INSIDER TRADING!!!).

      7. All contracts with past and present Congressmen/women are void. The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen/women. Congress made all these contracts by and for themselves. 

      Serving in Congress is an honor and privledge NOT a career. The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators should serve their term(s), then go home and go back to work ‚Ä¶ not get all kinds of freebies. 

      Just hold your finger down then hit forward and send it to everyone you know.
