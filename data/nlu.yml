    - No, I heard it is all a hoax
    - is climate change even real?
    - It's been changing for millions of years because the earth shifts on its axis while spinning in space. Things are going to change naturally, that's why Ohio was a glacier a million years ago and I can find salt water fossils in my backyard in middle Ga.
